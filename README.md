Zen.nvim is desgined to be a bare bones Neovim configuration to help any beginner who does not have a background in lua or vim.

At the time of this writing, it not suitable for anyone to really use. It has a bunch of dev and mapping references that are personal to me.
This is not a good configuration for someone to use.
